// OOPS in Python means Object-Oriented Programming System. 
// It is a programming style where we organize code using objects and classes, 
// making programs easier to manage, reuse, and understand.

// ✅ Class

// Definition:
// A class is a blueprint or template used to create objects. It defines the properties (variables) and behaviors (methods) that the objects will have.

// 👉 Example: Class = Car design.
