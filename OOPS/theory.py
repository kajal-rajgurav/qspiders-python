# // OOPS in Python means Object-Oriented Programming System. 
# // It is a programming style where we organize code using objects and classes, 
# // making programs easier to manage, reuse, and understand.

# // ✅ Class

# // Definition:
# // A class is a blueprint or template used to create objects. It defines the properties (variables) 
# and behaviors (methods) that the objects will have.

# // 👉 Example: Class = Car design.
# // ✅ Object

# // Definition:
# // An object is an instance of a class. It represents a real-world entity and contains data and methods defined by the class.

# // 👉 Example: A specific car created from the car design.

# // ✅ Encapsulation

# # // Definition:
# # // Encapsulation is the process of wrapping data and methods together into a single unit (class) and restricting direct access to some of the object's components to protect the data.

# # // 👉 Also called Data Hiding.

# # // ✅ Inheritance

# // Definition:
# // Inheritance is a mechanism in which one class acquires the properties and methods of another class, allowing code reuse and hierarchical relationships.

# // 👉 Parent → Child relationship.

# // ✅ Polymorphism

# // Definition:
# // Polymorphism means "many forms." It allows the same method or function name to perform different behaviors depending on the object.

# // 👉 One interface, multiple implementations.

# // ✅ Abstraction

# // Definition:
# // Abstraction is the process of hiding complex implementation details and showing only the essential features of an object.
